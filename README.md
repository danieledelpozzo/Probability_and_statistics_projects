# Probability & Statistics projects
A collection of university projects demonstrating applied probability, statistical modeling, simulations, and data analysis.



# Project 1 – Pseudo-Random Number Generators & Watts–Strogatz Model

This project was completed for the Probability and Statistics course at USI.
It explores pseudo-random number generation, Bernoulli trials, random adjacency matrices, and the Watts–Strogatz small-world model.
